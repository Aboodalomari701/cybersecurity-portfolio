# Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

## About Me
I am a Master’s in Cybersecurity student at the University of Malaya. My background includes academic and practical experience in network security and vulnerability assessment, with a long-term goal of becoming a professional Penetration Tester.


## Technical Skills
* **Network Security:** Expertise in EIGRP Routing, ACL implementation, and network topology design.
* **Security Tools:** Proficient in Nmap, Wireshark, GNS3, Kathará, and Scapy for vulnerability assessment and traffic analysis.
* **Programming & Automation:** Using Python for security scripting and integrating the Shodan API.
* **Environments:** Experienced with Docker for containerization and Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation.


## Project Experience

### 1. Network Security & Attack Simulation (GNS3)
* **Objective:** Designed a secure network topology using EIGRP and implemented Access Control Lists (ACLs) to protect the network.
* **Tools:** GNS3, Scapy, and macof.
* **Outcome:** Successfully demonstrated Layer 2 attacks (MAC flooding) and verified that the security configurations effectively mitigated the threats.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis via Shodan API
* **Objective:** Developed a Python-based tool to programmatically analyze CVEs and identify exposed network assets.
* **Tools:** Python, Shodan API, and Jupyter Notebook.
* **Outcome:** Created an automated script for threat assessment, allowing for faster identification of vulnerable services in a network.
